## Project Goal

A framework for hosting terminal-based multiplayer **games** over SSH. **Only the server operator needs to install anything.** Players connect with a plain `ssh` command — no client install required.

Games are written in JavaScript (goja) and loaded at runtime from `dist/games/`. The server binary itself is game-agnostic.

## Release & Distribution

**Binaries are NOT checked into git.** They are built and published automatically by GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): builds `null-space.exe` + `pinggy-helper.exe`, packages the full `dist/` folder into `null-space.zip`, and publishes a rolling `latest` release.
- **`install.ps1`** (repo root): one-liner installer for operators — downloads and extracts the latest release zip, creates desktop shortcuts. Usage: `irm https://github.com/simonthoresen/null-space/raw/main/install.ps1 | iex`
- **`start.ps1`** (in `dist/`): auto-updates on each launch — checks the GitHub release for a newer version and downloads the full zip (binaries, games, fonts) before starting.
- **Version tracking**: `dist/.version` stores the commit SHA of the installed release. Not tracked in git.

## Commands

```bash
make build          # compile to dist/null-space.exe + dist/pinggy-helper.exe
make run            # go run with --data-dir dist (dev shortcut)
make clean          # remove compiled binaries from dist/

go run ./cmd/null-space --data-dir dist   # equivalent to make run, add --password etc.
go test ./...

ssh -p 23234 localhost   # connect as a client (host plays this way too)

# Local mode — no SSH, runs full client TUI directly in the terminal.
# Useful as a render test-bed and as a local single-player mode.
go run ./cmd/null-space --local --data-dir dist
go run ./cmd/null-space --local --data-dir dist --game example
go run ./cmd/null-space --local --data-dir dist --game example --player alice
```

**Environment variables:**
- `NULL_SPACE_LOG_FILE` — path to log file (default: discard)
- `NULL_SPACE_LOG_LEVEL` — log level: debug/info/warn/error (default: info)
- `NULL_SPACE_PINGGY_STATUS_FILE` — path to Pinggy status file (enables tunnel bridge UI)

## Architecture

**null-space** is a "Multitenant Singleton" server over SSH.

### Core Pattern
- **One game singleton** runs on the server (`CentralState.ActiveGame`)
- **One Bubble Tea `Program` per SSH session**, all sharing the same game state
- **Central 100ms ticker** sends `TickMsg` to all programs simultaneously → synchronized real-time rendering
- **The server terminal is management-only.** The host joins as a player via SSH like everyone else.

### Game Lifecycle
```
LOBBY (teams + chat) → SPLASH → PLAYING → GAME OVER → LOBBY
```
1. **Lobby**: Players configure teams, chat. Admin loads game with `/game load <name>`.
2. **Load**: Framework snapshots teams for the game (lobby teams stay independent), loads saved state, calls `init(savedState)`. `teams()` returns game teams. Game can set `Game.splashScreen` dynamically.
3. **Splash**: Shows game splash screen (custom or default with game name). Admin presses Enter to start, or auto-starts after 10s.
4. **Splash→Playing**: Framework calls `start()`. Game sets up its playing state.
5. **Reconnect**: If a player disconnects mid-game and reconnects with the same name, they rejoin the game automatically.
5. **Playing**: Normal game mode. Game calls `gameOver(results, state)` when done.
4. **Game Over**: Framework renders ranked results screen. All players press Enter or 15s auto-transition.
5. Back to **Lobby** — game unloaded, teams preserved for next round.

Late joiners see the lobby and can chat but don't join the active game. Lobby teams are independent from game teams — players can freely organize for the next round while a game is running.

### Teams
Players manage teams in the lobby panel (right side, fixed 32 chars). New players start **unassigned** (shown under "Unassigned" at the top of the team list). Tab switches focus between chat and team panel. Navigation in team panel:
- **Down** from unassigned → join first team (or create one if none exist)
- **Down** from a team → move to team below
- **Down** from last team → create new "Team \<your name\>" (blocked if you're the sole member, to avoid drop/recreate churn)
- **Up** from a team → move to team above
- **Up** from first team → become unassigned
- **Enter** (first player in team) → rename team
- **Left/Right** (first player in team) → cycle team color

New teams default to "Team \<creator name\>" and the first unused palette color. Games can declare `teamRange: {min, max}` to enforce valid team counts. Games access teams via the `teams()` global, which returns `[{name, color, players: [{id, name}, ...]}, ...]`. Game teams are a snapshot taken at load time — lobby teams remain editable during a game. Unassigned players are excluded from the game snapshot.

### State Persistence
Games persist state by passing it as the second argument to `gameOver(results, state)`. On the next load, it's received as the argument to `init(savedState)`. State files are stored as JSON in `dist/state/<gamename>.json`.

### UI Layout

**Lobby (no game loaded):**
```
│ File  Edit  View  Help              │  NC menu bar (overlay, row 0)

```

**In-game:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Menu bar (1 row) — framework        │  game name
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Status bar (1 row) — game-owned     │  Game.StatusBar(playerID) → "HP: 100  Score: 4200"
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│ Game viewport (W × W*9/16 rows)     │  Game.Render(playerID, W, H)
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│ Chat (remaining rows, min 5)        │  shared chat history
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Command bar (1 row) — dual-purpose  │  idle: Game.CommandBar(playerID) → "[↑↓] Move"
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Status bar (1 row) — framework      │  server time right-aligned              always
└─────────────────────────────────────┘  on Enter: text input; submit/Esc: reverts
```


**Viewport sizing:** Ideal `gameH = W * 9 / 16`. Chat gets the remaining rows. `minChatH = max(5, (H-4)/3)` — chat always gets at least ⅓ of content rows (4 overhead rows: menu bar + game status bar + command bar + status bar). Command bar is always 1 row.

**Chat scroll buffer:** 200 lines per player. `PgUp`/`PgDn` scroll the chat panel in both idle and input modes. Multi-line command replies (e.g. `/help`) are split into individual lines before storage.

**Command history:** 50 entries per player. In input mode, `↑`/`↓` browse history. `↓` past the newest entry restores the draft that was in the input box when browsing started. History does not rotate.

### The `Game` Interface (`common/interfaces.go`)
```go
type Game interface {
    GameName() string                      // display name (fallback: filename stem)
    TeamRange() TeamRange                  // {Min, Max} — zero = no constraint
    SplashScreen() string                  // splash screen content (empty = use default)
    Init(savedState any)                   // called before splash with persisted state
    Start()                                // called at splash→playing transition
    Update(dt float64)                     // called once per tick with seconds since last update
    OnPlayerLeave(playerID string)
    OnInput(playerID, key string)
    Render(buf *ImageBuffer, playerID string, x, y, width, height int) // write game viewport into buffer
    RenderNC(playerID string, width, height int) *WidgetNode           // declarative NC layout (nil = use Render)
    StatusBar(playerID string) string      // game status bar (2nd row, below menu bar)
    CommandBar(playerID string) string     // command bar (above framework status bar)
    Commands() []Command
    Unload()
}
```
`jsRuntime` implements `Game`. `init()` is mandatory; all other JS hooks are optional. `teams()` global returns game team snapshot during init/start/playing.

### Central Clock (`common/clock.go`)
The framework provides a central `Clock` interface (`Now() time.Time`) used for all time-related operations. Games access it via the `now()` JS global (epoch milliseconds). In tests, inject a `MockClock` to control time. `Update(dt)` receives the real elapsed seconds between ticks.

### Game Over

Games call `gameOver(results, state)` where `results` is an array of `{ name, result }` in ranked order and `state` is an optional object to persist for the next run. The framework renders the game-over screen — games don't need to provide their own. `name` is the display name (player or team). `result` is a freeform string (e.g. `"4200 pts"`, `"1st"`, `"DNF"`). Both arguments are optional. State is received via `config.savedState` in `init()` on the next load.

### Commands (`common/interfaces.go`)
```go
type Command struct {
    Name             string
    Description      string
    AdminOnly        bool
    FirstArgIsPlayer bool                     // Tab-completes first arg against player names
    Complete         func(before []string) []string  // context-aware completion; overrides FirstArgIsPlayer
    Handler          func(ctx CommandContext, args []string)
}
```

`ctx.Reply(text)` sends a private response to the caller only. For SSH players it sends a `ChatMsg` with `IsPrivate: true`. For the console (playerID `""`) it appends directly to the console's chat panel — **not** to the server log. Tab completion cycles through candidates alphabetically; repeated Tab advances through the list.

`GameName` in `CentralState` stores the bare name (e.g. `example`), not the full file path. `loadGame` strips the directory and `.js` extension. Commands that broadcast game load/unload events should use the bare name too — `loadGame` already broadcasts `"Game loaded: <name>"` to chat, so command handlers must not send a redundant reply.

### `Message` Type (`common/types.go`)
```go
type Message struct {
    Author    string
    Text      string
    IsPrivate bool
    ToID      string
    FromID    string
    IsReply   bool  // command response — rendered as plain text, no "[system]" or "[PM]" prefix
}
```

`IsReply: true` is set by `ctx.Reply()` so command output (e.g. `/help` listing) appears as plain text in the caller's chat window with no prefix. Without it, private messages show `[PM from X]`.

### Games (JS)

Games live in `dist/games/` as either single `.js` files or folders containing `main.js` (for multi-file games using `include()`). Loaded at runtime via `/game load <name>`. A HTTPS URL can be given instead of a name — `.js` files are cached in `dist/games/.cache/`, `.zip` files are extracted to `dist/games/<name>/`. GitHub blob URLs are converted to raw automatically.

**Game** — exports a global `Game` object with hooks `update`, `onPlayerLeave`, `onInput`, `render`, `renderNC`, `statusBar`, `commandBar`. Optional properties: `gameName`, `teamRange`, `splashScreen`. Mandatory `init(savedState)` called on load. Loaded one at a time; owns the viewport. `update(dt)` is called once per tick with elapsed seconds — all game logic belongs here. `render(buf, playerID, ox, oy, w, h)` receives an `ImageBuffer` and writes pixels directly via `buf.setChar(x, y, ch, fg, bg)`, `buf.writeString(x, y, text, fg, bg)`, `buf.fill(x, y, w, h, ch, fg, bg)`. Colors are `"#RRGGBB"` hex strings or `null`. Attribute constants: `ATTR_BOLD`, `ATTR_FAINT`, `ATTR_ITALIC`, `ATTR_UNDERLINE`, `ATTR_REVERSE`. `renderNC` returns a declarative widget tree that the framework renders using real NC controls; if defined, `render()` is only called for `{type: "gameview"}` nodes within the tree. Interactive node types (`button`, `textinput`, `checkbox`) route actions back via `onInput(playerID, action)`. Tab cycles focus between interactive controls; Esc returns to raw `onInput` mode.

**Global functions available to JS:** `log()`, `chat()`, `chatPlayer()`, `teams()`, `now()`, `registerCommand()`, `gameOver(results, state)`, `figlet(text, font?)` (ASCII art via figlet4go; built-in fonts: `"standard"`, `"larry3d"`; extra fonts loaded from `dist/fonts/*.flf` at startup), `include(name)` (evaluate another `.js` file from the same directory — for multi-file games).

**Full developer documentation:** see `API-REFERENCE.md` at the repo root.

### Plugins (JS)

Per-player (or per-console) JavaScript extensions in `dist/plugins/`. Loaded with `/plugin load <name|url>`. Each player/console maintains their own plugin list — plugins are not shared.

A plugin exports a `Plugin` object with an `onMessage(author, text, isSystem)` hook. The hook is called for every chat message (or log line, for console plugins). If it returns a non-empty string, that string is dispatched as if the player typed it — starting with `/` means a command, otherwise it's sent as chat. Return `null` to do nothing.

**Use cases:** auto-greeting bots, chat responders, server management scripts, auto-moderation.

**Global JS:** `log()` only (for debug output).

**Bundled plugins:** `greeter` (welcomes new players), `echo` (echoes `!echo` messages).

### Shaders (JS / Go)

Per-player (or per-console) post-processing scripts in `dist/shaders/`. Loaded with `/shader load <name|url>`. Each player/console maintains their own ordered shader list. Shaders run in sequence on the fully-rendered `ImageBuffer` **after** the screen is composed but **before** overlays (menus, dialogs) and `ToString()`.

A JS shader exports a `Shader` object with a required `process(buf)` method. `buf` exposes:
- `width`, `height` — buffer dimensions
- `getPixel(x, y)` → `{char, fg, bg, attr}` or `null` — read a cell
- `setChar(x, y, ch, fg, bg, attr)` — write a cell
- `writeString(x, y, text, fg, bg, attr)` — write text
- `fill(x, y, w, h, ch, fg, bg, attr)` — fill rectangle
- `recolor(x, y, w, h, fg, bg, attr)` — change colors without changing characters

Optional hooks: `init()` (called once on load), `unload()` (called on removal).

**Go shaders** implement `common.Shader` interface: `Name() string`, `Process(buf *ImageBuffer)`, `Unload()`. Compiled into the binary.

**Commands:** `/shader` (list), `/shader load <name>`, `/shader unload <name>`, `/shader list`, `/shader up <name>`, `/shader down <name>`.

**Menu:** File → Shaders... shows active shaders with order and available shaders.

**Bundled shaders:** `invert` (swap fg/bg), `scanlines` (dim alternating rows), `crt` (green-on-black retro terminal).

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `internal/engine/shader.go` | JS shader runtime: `jsShader`, `LoadShader()`, `applyShaders()`, JS buffer wrapper with `getPixel`/`setChar`/`recolor` |

### Init Files (`~/.null-space/`)

Both files: one command per line; lines starting with `#` are comments. Dispatched on the first tick after the UI is running. Lives in the home directory so they survive reinstalls.

**`~/.null-space/server.txt`** — commands run automatically when the server console starts. Useful for loading a default game, setting a theme, or loading server-side plugins.

**`~/.null-space/client.txt`** — commands run automatically when a player joins a server (or starts in `--local` mode). The join script reads this file, base64-encodes it, and sends it via the `NULL_SPACE_INIT` SSH environment variable.

Example `~/.null-space/server.txt`:
```
# Server auto-setup
/theme dark
/game load invaders
```

Example `~/.null-space/client.txt`:
```
# Client auto-setup
/theme dark
/plugin load greeter
```

### Themes

JSON files in `dist/themes/` that control the NC-style chrome colors. Switch at runtime with `/theme <name>` (per-player, not global). Bundled themes: `norton` (default), `dark`, `light`.

Themes use a 4-layer depth model matching the original Norton Commander. Each layer (`ThemeLayer`) carries **both** a color palette (`Palette`) **and** a border character set (`BorderSet`):

| Layer | Depth | NC role |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Primary | 0 | Desktop: main windows, panels |
| Secondary | 1, 3, 5… | Menus, dropdowns, status bar |
| Tertiary | 2, 4, 6… | Dialogs, nested popups |
| Warning | (explicit) | Error/warning dialogs |

`Theme.LayerAt(depth)` returns the layer, cycling Secondary/Tertiary for depth > 0. `Theme.WarningLayer()` returns the Warning layer regardless of depth. `Theme.ShadowStyle()` is global (not per-layer).

**Color fields** (per layer): `bg/fg`, `accent`, `highlightBg/Fg`, `activeBg/Fg`, `inputBg/Fg`, `disabledFg`. **Border fields** (per layer): outer frame (`outerTL/TR/BL/BR/H/V`), inner dividers (`innerH/V`), intersections (`crossL/R/T/B/X`), bar separator (`barSep`). Defaults: double-line outer (`╔═╗║╚╝`), single-line inner (`─│`), intersections (`╟╢╤╧`). Any omitted field falls back to hardcoded defaults. Different layers can use different border styles (e.g., double-line for desktop, single-line for menus).

**Render signatures:** `Control.Render(buf, x, y, w, h, focused, layer)` writes directly into a `*ImageBuffer`. `Window.Render(x, y, w, h, layer) string` creates a buffer internally and returns `ToString()`. `Window.RenderToBuf(buf, x, y, w, h, layer)` writes into a caller-provided buffer. Menu/dialog renderers (`RenderMenuBar`, `RenderDropdown`, `RenderDialog`) still return strings — their output is painted into the buffer via `PaintANSI` + `Blit`.

**Widget tree reconciler** (`internal/widget/reconcile.go`): `ReconcileGameWindow()` builds real `Control` instances from a `WidgetNode` tree, reusing controls by tree path to preserve state (focus, cursor, scroll) across frames. Supports interactive nodes: `button` (action via OnInput), `textinput` (submit via OnInput), `checkbox` (toggle via OnInput), `textview` (scrollable), `gameview` (optionally focusable). NC framework owns focus — Tab cycles controls, Esc blurs all, unfocused keys fall through to `game.OnInput()`.

**JSON backwards compat**: Global border fields at the theme root are copied into any layer that has empty borders via `resolveDefaults()`. New themes should define borders per-layer.

## Server Console

`internal/console/console.go` is its own Bubble Tea program on the local terminal. Two phases:

### Phase 1 — Boot sequence

Each step is printed in two passes:
1. **Before** the operation: `label ...................` (dots to fill line, no status, no newline)
2. **After** the operation: `\r` overwrites the line with `label ........ [ STATUS ]` right-aligned

Status tokens are always **8 chars wide** with the text centered:
```
[ DONE ]   (DONE = 4 chars, no padding)
[ FAIL ]   (FAIL = 4 chars, no padding)
[ SKIP ]   (SKIP = 4 chars, no padding)
```

Implementation: `startBootStep(label)` / `finishBootStep(status)` in `cmd/null-space/main.go`. Terminal width via `github.com/charmbracelet/x/term`. The PS1 script has matching `Write-BootStepStart` / `Write-BootStepEnd` helpers.

Startup sequence (PS1 steps first, then Go binary):
```
Setting up network ......................................... [ DONE ]  ← PS1 header
Pinggy helper .............................................. [ DONE ]  ← PS1
SSH server ................................................. [ DONE ]  ← Go
UPnP port mapping .......................................... [ SKIP ]
Public IP detection ........................................ [ SKIP ]
Pinggy tunnel .............................................. [ DONE ]
Generating invite command .................................. [ DONE ]

  <invite command>

  (console UI runs)

Initiating shutdown ........................................ [ DONE ]  ← Go
Shutting down network ...................................... [ DONE ]  ← Go header
Stopping SSH server ........................................ [ DONE ]  ← Go
Stopping Pinggy helper ..................................... [ DONE ]  ← PS1
```

In `--local` mode, group headers show `[ SKIP ]` (yellow) and substeps are omitted:
```
Setting up network ......................................... [ SKIP ]  ← PS1
Generating invite command .................................. [ SKIP ]  ← Go
  (local TUI runs)
Initiating shutdown ........................................ [ DONE ]  ← Go
Shutting down network ...................................... [ SKIP ]  ← Go
```

### Phase 2 — Console UI

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Menu bar (1 row, with spinner)      │  "null-space | game: none | teams: 0 | uptime 00:42 ⠹"
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│ Log (scrollable, fills height)      │  slog lines + all chat (global + private)
│                                     │  PgUp/PgDn to scroll
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Command bar (1 row)                 │  '/' = command; plain text = chat as [admin]
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Status bar (1 row)                  │  server time right-aligned
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The server console is always admin. SSH clients elevate via `/admin <password>`. Password set via `--password`; changeable at runtime via `/password <new>` (admin only).

---

## Connection Strategy

Startup order: UPnP → Pinggy → generate invite script.

The invite command is a raw PowerShell one-liner (paste into a PowerShell window): `$env:NS='<token>';irm <join.ps1 URL>|iex`. The `NS` environment variable is a base64url-encoded binary token:

| Bytes | Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 0–1 | SSH port (uint16 BE) | Shared by localhost, LAN, UPnP |
| 2–5 | LAN IP (4 bytes) | `0.0.0.0` = absent |
| 6–9 | Public/UPnP IP (4 bytes) | `0.0.0.0` = absent |
| 10–11 | Pinggy port (uint16 BE) | `0` = no Pinggy |
| 12+ | Pinggy hostname (UTF-8) | Remaining bytes |

Variable-length: trailing absent fields are omitted. `join.ps1` always tries `localhost` first (not encoded). Field presence is determined by token length: ≥6 → LAN, ≥10 → public IP, ≥12 → Pinggy.

Each attempt uses a short `ConnectTimeout`; falls through on failure.

`pinggy-helper.exe` stdout/stderr are redirected to `dist/logs/pinggy-stdout.log` / `pinggy-stderr.log` by `start.ps1` — they must not pollute the boot sequence output.

---

## Concurrency — Lock Ordering

Two primary mutexes protect shared state:

| Mutex | Type | Location | Protects |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| `CentralState.mu` | RWMutex | `internal/state/state.go` | Players, teams, game phase, chat history, network info |
| `jsRuntime.mu` | Mutex | `internal/engine/runtime.go` | Goja JS VM and all JS callback execution |

**Invariant:** `jsRuntime` must **never** acquire `CentralState.mu`. This is enforced structurally — `jsRuntime` has no reference to `CentralState`. Data flows through:
- **Teams:** Server builds a cache (`buildTeamsCache`) and pushes it via `SetTeamsCache()`. JS `teams()` reads the local cache.
- **Chat:** JS `chat()`/`chatPlayer()` send on a buffered channel; a server goroutine drains it and calls `broadcastChat()`.

**Callers** (`server/server.go`, `internal/chrome/chrome.go`) must release `state.mu` **before** calling any `jsRuntime` Game method (`Init`, `Start`, `Update`, `Render`, `OnInput`, etc.). All existing call sites follow this pattern — verify any new ones do too.

Other mutexes (`programsMu`, `sessionsMu`, `consoleProgramMu`, `commandRegistry.mu`) are leaf locks — they don't call into JS or acquire `state.mu`.

## Slog Feedback Loop Guard

**Never add `slog` calls to `View()` or `Render()` methods.** The console routes slog → channel → Update → View, so any slog call in the render path creates an infinite feedback loop (high CPU, starved keyboard events).

The `consoleSlogHandler` has a runtime guard (`isRenderPath()`) that inspects the call stack and suppresses console-channel sends from inside `.View` or `.Render` methods. This is a safety net — the primary rule is still: don't log from render paths. `TestNoSlogInRenderPath` scans render-path source files for slog calls; `TestSlogBlockedInRenderPath` verifies the runtime guard.

## SSH Input Handling (Windows gotcha)

Use `ssh.EmulatePty()` — **not** `ssh.AllocatePty()` — in all three call sites in `server/server.go`.

On Windows, `AllocatePty` creates a real ConPTY. The `charmbracelet/ssh` library then spawns `go io.Copy(sess.pty, sess)` internally. When Bubble Tea also reads from the session, two goroutines alternate consuming bytes and **every other keystroke is dropped**.

`EmulatePty` stores PTY metadata (term type, window size) without spawning a ConPTY, so there is only one reader. Search for `EmulatePty` in `server/server.go` to find all three call sites.
